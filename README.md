# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Transportation is vital for the function of any city, regardless of size. PyBer plans to address the disparities of their services between urban, suburban, and rural cities within the PyBer coverage area.

## Results
Data provided included ride identification numbers, cities, number of drivers, date and time of rides, and fares. Cities were already determined to be typed by urban, suburban, and rural. For the purposes of this analysis, we assume that each city typeâ€™s size is related to population density, not just by land sprawl.

Understandably, urban cities had the most rides and drivers to provide them. Urban cities had 2.6 times the number of rides as suburban cities and 21 times the number of rides in rural cities. Suburban cities had five times the number of rides than rural. The urban cities also had the most drivers, with five times the number of drivers in the suburban cities and 31 times the number of drivers in rural cities. 

What the urban cities also had, if you look at Total Rides and Total Drivers, is nearly 1.5 drivers for every ride provided. This brings down the average fares per ride and average fares per driver, although distances driven would very much play a factor as well. With data on distances of the rides, we could determine if the fares were determined more by mileage than availability of a driver, especially in rural and suburban areas.

Pricing and availability are affecting service in rural cities far more than suburban and urban cities. Data collected for the first calendar quarter of 2019 shows steady growth for each city type, but when we extended the dataset to include April, urban and suburban city usage continued to climb while usage in the rural cities dramatically dropped.

## Summary
The unique selling point of PyBer is using connections to provide transportation: helping someone get from here to there by finding someone to take them. Our data also revealed what appears to be incomplete bookings. Anecdotally, urban cities customers are believed to book one driver, then cancel if another driver is closer, but this is less likely in both suburban and rural cities with fewer drivers available. If we research why the bookings were incomplete, especially in rural cities, we can find out if the main reasons include lack of drivers at the time desired. 

With distance data we can understand where riders need to go, and we can also determine where in suburban and especially rural cities to recruit drivers, possibly with incentives, to be more available during peak times. The demand for PyBer is indeed in rural and suburban areas, but we need more drivers in order to make the connection.
